# ForestCoverPrediction
The primary goal is to create a forest cover type prediction model for 30x30 meter cells in the Roosevelt National Forest. This model enhances our ecological understanding, particularly in undisturbed wilderness areas.

# Forest Cover Prediction

## Problem Statement

- **Task 1:** Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.

- **Task 2:** Create a predictive model that accurately classifies seven different forest cover types in four wilderness areas of the Roosevelt National Forest with the best accuracy.

## Dataset

- The dataset includes features like elevation, aspect, slope, distances to hydrology and roadways, hillshade indices, wilderness area designations, soil type designations, and forest cover type labels.
- The goal is to predict the forest cover type in 30x30 meter cells within the Roosevelt National Forest.

## Data Fields

- Elevation, Aspect, Slope, Distances, Hillshade indices, Wilderness Areas, Soil Types, Cover Types.
- Wilderness areas are designated by binary columns (0 = absence, 1 = presence).
- Soil types are designated by binary columns (0 = absence, 1 = presence).

## Objectives

- Develop a predictive model that accurately classifies seven different forest cover types.
- Utilize robust machine learning models for extensive classification.
- Enhance understanding of forest ecological processes in undisturbed wilderness areas.
- Improve predictions for land cover in the Roosevelt National Forest.

**Note:** All tasks are implemented in a single Jupyter notebook, available for the final project submission.
